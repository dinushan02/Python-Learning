# In this tutorial, I am going to talk to
# you guys about another important structure.
# Tuples are similar to lists, so we can use them to store a list of items.
# But unlike lists we cannot modify them, we cannot add new items,
# we cannot remove existing items.
# Tuples are immutable. We cannot mutable or change them.
# ğŸ˜ƒLet me show you.So I am going to start by defining a list of numbers.
# We can count and index. (2)
# 1.We use count() to count the number of occurrences in an item,
# and 2.index(), to find the index of the first occurrence,
# ğŸ™ƒWe can only get information about a tuple, we cannot change it.


numbers = (1, 2, 3)
#numbers[0] = 10
print(numbers[0]) # 1
